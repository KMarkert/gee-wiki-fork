Welcome to the gee-wiki !

This Wiki is aimed to provide the GEE users' community a placeholder to develop documentation for GEE. There are ongoing discussions with GEE folks how to integrate this content into the official GEE documentation pages.

This Wiki is using Travis CI to sync with a secondary repository https://github.com/gee-contrib/gee-wiki-fork. To contribute to this Wiki, fork from that repository and send a pull request.

As a starting point for developing, a group of GEE Users and frequent Help Forum participants discussed the idea to build 'Masterclass' tutorials to be added to https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials. In the future, we may expand this to include also dataset descriptions, feature/API documentation, workshop content and academic curriculum. A list of suggested masterclass topics/sections is below. We plan to move on to the next step on or soon after March 1st 2019. We will have a small group of lead authors who will be able to directly edit and accept(commit) changes, but everyone is welcomed to contribute text or edits. Each topic will include attribution to the authors and contributers. 

**As a first step suggestions/comments (and volunteers) for these masterclass tutorials are welcomed!** To provide your input, please open a new Issue on the repository. We ask that you choose a title that mention the masterclass topic (or a new one) so others can respond and contribute to the Issue with their thoughts.

Welcome to the gee-wiki !

This Wiki is aimed to provide the GEE users' community a placeholder to develop documentation for GEE. There are ongoing discussions with GEE folks how to integrate this content into the official GEE documentation pages.

This Wiki is using Travis CI to sync with a secondary repository https://github.com/gee-contrib/gee-wiki-fork. To contribute to this Wiki, fork from that repository and send a pull request.

As a starting point for developing, a group of GEE Users and frequent Help Forum participants discussed the idea to build 'Masterclass' topics to be added to https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials. A list of suggested masterclass topics is below. **As a first step, suggestions/comments (and volunteers to write these masterclass tutorials!) are welcomed!**. We plan to move on to the next step on or soon after March 1st 2019. To provide your input, please open a new Issue on the repository. We ask that you choose a title that mention the masterclass topic (or a new one) so others can respond and contribute to the Issue with their thoughts.
